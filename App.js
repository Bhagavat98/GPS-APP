Request for Work from Home for Medical Recovery

Hi Chetan Sir and Gurpreet Sir,

     As you know I had met with an major accident last year due to which a surgery was required to fix the plate in my right hand as it was totally damaged ,as per doctors suggestion I am not allowed to drive or lift heavy objects until the plate is removed,  so I kindly request you to give me some time to work from home till February/10/2025. 

Please find the attached surgery reports for your reference.

Thanks & Regards
Bhagavat Solanke
